[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is fairly easy to use and the has great documentation.  I used this [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and it helped to get the file structure figured out.  Quick tip, just use the command `$jekyll serve` to get a local version up and running.  It will watch for changes by default.
