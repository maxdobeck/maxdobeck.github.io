<h1>Hi I'm Max</h1>
<small>and this is a record of some stuff I've tried</small>


<p>I'm experimenting with different Frontend and Backend solutions, APIs, and infrastructure models.  You can expect to find anything from the crypto to proper database backup policies.  But for the most part I work with React, Rails, Express.js, and Postgres.  Even if you don't use any of the above I think the concepts can transcend frameworks.</p>
<p>Shoot me an email(see below) if you want to talk.</p>
