<h1>Hi I'm Max</h1>
<small>and this is a record of some stuff I've tried</small>


<p>I'm experimenting with different Frontend and Backend solutions, APIs, infrastructure setups, and deployment pipelines.  You can expect to find anything from testing methodology to deployment examples.  I'm focused on the world of the web and problems faced by end users.</p>
<p>You can shoot me an email(see below) if you want to chat or point out some glaring mistakes.</p>
