<h1>Hi I'm Max</h1>
<small>and this is a record of some stuff I've tried</small>


<p>I'm rapidly advancing my agenda and expanding my brand.  I'm mostly into Nodejs right now but I can for sure talk about whatever.</p>  
<p>For the uninitiated Nodejs is like the borg.  I resisted for so long but eventually I ended up in the cube npm-ing my way around recklessly adding packages to create an unmaintainable web of dependencies.</p>  
<p>For now I'm enjoying the ride atop this house of cards but if you wann see more check out the github or shoot me an email below. No spam please.</p>
